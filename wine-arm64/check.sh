# The arm64 Wine runtime on the maintainer's Mac (native arm64 spec §7.3): `make wine-arm64-check`.
# Usage: check.sh [step...]   no step = all, in STEPS' order. Needs `make build wine-arm64 wine-arm64-tests`, and the
# dxmt steps `make dxmt-tests presenter dxmt-tests-arm64ec`. g4-bench, for its Rosetta baseline, and the dxmt-* steps,
# for their D3DMetal reference, need the frozen Rosetta reference (tools/freeze-rosetta-reference.sh;
# MACNEUTRON_REFERENCE names another), run by its own launcher. dxmt-x64's FSR 3 check needs SMITE 2 installed
# (Steam): its amd_fidelityfx_dx12.dll, read from the game's install, never copied. steam-bridge needs `make bridge`,
# Steam running and logged in, and SMITE 2 installed (its steam_api64.dll, read in place), or MACNEUTRON_STEAM_API naming
# another game's steam_api64.dll (the aoe2 fork uses AoE2DE's), as release.sh's R3 does.
# Every run starts fresh: a new clone of the staged bundle, a new prefix. The clone sits at a path with a space, as the
# app installs it. A step that needs a prefix gets one from `boot`, which runs first if it isn't named.
# Nothing of the runtime is left after the script exits, whatever the reason: the last line is PASS or FAIL orphans.
