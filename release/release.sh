# MacNeutron's release (arm64 release spec §6.3, §14), into build/release/<X.Y.Z>/: refuses development inputs, naming
# each; stages a stripped wine.app (bundle.sh --release) and runs R3 on it; notarizes and staples it (L6's notarized
# row on an installed copy); builds MacNeutron.app around it, checks its licences (R4), notarizes it (R2) and zips it;
# builds the source archive and checks it against the bundle's SOURCE (R5); writes SHA256SUMS and SIZES.txt and prints
# the tag and gh release commands. It never tags, pushes or uploads.
#   make release VERSION=X.Y.Z    make checks the version, builds the CLI, steam.exe and wine.app, then runs:
#   release.sh X.Y.Z
#   release.sh --rehearse X.Y.Z   the same into build/release/rehearse-X.Y.Z/ (with a REHEARSAL file), without the
#                                 clean-tree, origin/main and origin tag refusals and without notarization: nothing
#                                 goes to Apple, and no tag commands are printed
#   release.sh --check-version X.Y.Z   the version refusal alone (exit 0, or 2 saying why)
#   release.sh --self-test        each refusal on prepared bad inputs (gate R1)
# Any other arguments print the usage and exit 2.
# Needs MACNEUTRON_SIGN_IDENTITY and MACNEUTRON_PROVISIONING_PROFILE, the network (origin, the DXMT fork, Apple's
# timestamps) and, for a release, MACNEUTRON_NOTARY_PROFILE (default macneutron). R3 needs Steam running and logged in
# and a game's steam_api64.dll: MACNEUTRON_STEAM_API, by default SMITE 2's.

MacNeutron is under the MIT licence (LICENSE, beside this file).

steam.exe (Contents/Resources/steam.exe), MacNeutron's own Windows-side Steam stub, is built with llvm-mingw and links
its mingw-w64 runtime: llvm-mingw's licence is LICENSE.TXT and the runtime's notices COPYING.MinGW-w64-runtime.txt,
beside this file.

The runtime, Contents/Helpers/wine.app (Wine, FEX, DXMT, FreeType, gnutls, nettle, GMP, LLVM, lsteamclient and
MacNeutron's MetalFX presenter), carries every component's licence and the exact sources it is built from in
Contents/Helpers/wine.app/Contents/Resources/licenses/ (README there first; SOURCE names each commit).
